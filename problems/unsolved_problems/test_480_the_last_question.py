# The Last Question
"""
Consider all the words which can be formed by selecting letters, in any order, from the phrase:

Suppose those with 15 letters or less are listed in alphabetical order and numbered sequentially starting at 1.
The list would include:
Define P(w) as the position of the word w.
Define W(p) as the word in position p.
We can see that P(w) and W(p) are inverses: P(W(p)) = p and W(P(w)) = w.
Examples:
Find W(P(legionary) + P(calorimeters) - P(annihilate) + P(orchestrated) - P(fluttering)).
Give your answer using lowercase characters (no punctuation or space).
