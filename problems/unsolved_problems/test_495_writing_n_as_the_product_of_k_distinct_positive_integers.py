# Writing n as the product of k distinct positive integers
"""
Let W(n,k) be the number of ways in which n can be written as the product of k distinct positive integers.
For example, W(144,4) = 7. There are 7 ways in which 144 can be written as a product of 4 distinct positive integers:

Note that permutations of the integers themselves are not considered distinct.
Furthermore, W(100!,10) modulo 1 000 000 007 = 287549200.
Find W(10000!,30) modulo 1 000 000 007.
