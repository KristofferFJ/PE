Ordered radicals

The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of the distinct prime factors of n. For example, 504 = 23 × 32 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.
If we calculate rad(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, then sort them on rad(n), and sorting on n if the radical values are equal, we get:
Let E(k) be the kth element in the sorted n column; for example, E(4) = 8 and E(6) = 9.
If rad(n) is sorted for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, find E(10000).
