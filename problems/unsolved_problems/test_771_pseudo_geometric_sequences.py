Pseudo Geometric Sequences


We define a pseudo-geometric sequence to be a finite sequence $a_0, a_1, \dotsc, a_n$ of positive integers, satisfying the following conditions:


Let $G(N)$ be the number of different pseudo-geometric sequences whose terms do not exceed $N$.
For example, $G(6) = 4$, as the following $4$ sequences give a complete list:


Also, $G(10) = 26$, $G(100) = 4710$ and $G(1000) = 496805$.

Find $G(10^{18})$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
