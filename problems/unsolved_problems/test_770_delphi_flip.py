Delphi Flip


A and B play a game. A has originally $1$ gram of gold and B has an unlimited amount.
Each round goes as follows:


B TAKEs $n$ times and GIVEs $n$ times after which the game finishes.

Define $g(X)$ to be the smallest value of $n$ so that A can guarantee to have at least $X$ grams of gold at the end of the game. You are given $g(1.7) = 10$.


Find $g(1.9999)$.
