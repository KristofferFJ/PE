# Permuted Matrices
""" 
An ascent of a column j in a matrix occurs if the value of column j is smaller than the value of column j+1 in all rows.


Let P(k, r, n) be the number of r x n matrices with the following properties:
For example, P(1, 2, 3) = 19, P(2, 4, 6) = 65508751 and  P(7, 5, 30) mod 1000000123 = 161858102.
Find Q(50000) mod 1000000123.
