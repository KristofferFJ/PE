Alexandrian Integers

We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there exist integers p, q, r such that:
$$A = p \cdot q \cdot r$$
and
$$\dfrac{1}{A} = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{1}{q} + \dfrac{1}{r}$$
For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer ($p = 5, q = -7, r = -18$).
In fact, 630 is the 6th Alexandrian integer,  the first 6 Alexandrian integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420, and 630.
Find the 150000th Alexandrian integer.
